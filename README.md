# ClassicAPI

A small DLL for World of Warcraft 1.12.1 (Vanilla / Turtle WoW) that adds a
couple of Lua API calls Blizzard never exposed in 1.12 but which make addon
authoring noticeably less painful — primarily for backporting addons written
against later API versions (3.3.5+) where these calls do exist.

The DLL hooks the FrameScript engine after WoW boots and registers its
extensions through the same in-engine mechanisms WoW uses for its own Lua
functions. No companion addon is required.

## Lua API

### `GameTooltip:SetSpellByID(spellID)`

Renders a spell tooltip for any `spellID`, including spells the player has
not learned. The stock 1.12 `GameTooltip:SetSpell(slot, bookType)` only works
for entries in the player's spellbook (or pet book). `SetSpellByID` bypasses
the spellbook indirection and calls WoW's internal tooltip builder directly.

```lua
GameTooltip:SetOwner(UIParent, "ANCHOR_CURSOR")
GameTooltip:SetSpellByID(133)  -- Fireball
GameTooltip:Show()
```

Equivalent to the function of the same name introduced in 3.0.

### `GetQuestIDFromLogIndex(index)`

Returns the questID (Quest.dbc row ID) for the entry at the given 1-based
quest log index. In 3.3.5 this came as the 9th return of `GetQuestLogTitle`;
in 1.12 it isn't returned at all, even though the engine has it internally.

- Returns the questID for real quests.
- Returns `0` for header rows (zone / category dividers).
- Returns `nil` if the index is out of range.

```lua
for i = 1, GetNumQuestLogEntries() do
    local title, level, questTag, isHeader, isCollapsed, isComplete
        = GetQuestLogTitle(i)
    local questID = GetQuestIDFromLogIndex(i)  -- 0 for headers
    -- ...
end
```

### `C_Item.IsBound(itemLocation)`

Returns `true` if the item at the given location is soulbound, `false` otherwise
(including when the slot is empty or the location is malformed). The 1.12
client tracks the soulbound bit on each item instance directly; previously
the only way to read it from Lua was a scan-tooltip hack
(`SetBagItem` + string-compare against the localized `ITEM_SOULBOUND`
constant) — slow, locale-fragile, and one of the hottest paths during bag
updates.

`itemLocation` is a table with one of these shapes (matching the modern
`ItemLocation` mixin):

```lua
{ equipmentSlotIndex = N }     -- 1-based, character pane
{ bagID = B, slotIndex = S }   -- both required
```

```lua
if C_Item.IsBound({equipmentSlotIndex = INVSLOT_HEAD}) then ... end
if C_Item.IsBound({bagID = 0, slotIndex = 1}) then ... end
```

### `C_Item.GetItemID(itemLocation)`

Returns the itemID of the item at the given location, or `nil` if the slot
is empty or the location is malformed. Useful as the input to
`GetItemInfoInstant`/`GetItemInfo` when you only know which slot an item
came from (rather than its link or ID).

Accepts the same `itemLocation` shapes as `IsBound`:

```lua
local id = C_Item.GetItemID({equipmentSlotIndex = INVSLOT_HEAD})
if id then
    local _, type, subtype = C_Item.GetItemInfoInstant(id)
    -- ...
end
```

### `C_Item.GetItemInfoInstant(item)`

Modern-style accessor for the always-available subset of item info — the
fields that depend only on classification, not on player-specific state.
Returns immediately from the client-side item cache; no server round-trip,
no async polling. Returns `nil` if the item isn't in cache.

Accepts a numeric `itemID` or a string containing `"item:NNN"` (matches both
the bare `"item:1234"` shorthand and full chat links like
`"|cff...|Hitem:1234:...|h[Name]|h|r"`). Item names are not accepted —
vanilla itself has no name → ID resolver, and it's rarely the form addon code
actually has on hand.

Returns seven values:

```
itemID, itemType, itemSubType, itemEquipLoc, icon, classID, subClassID
```

- `itemType` / `itemSubType` are the localized class / subclass names
  (e.g. `"Weapon"` / `"One-Handed Swords"`), read from `ItemClass.dbc` and
  `ItemSubClass.dbc`.
- `itemEquipLoc` is the `"INVTYPE_*"` constant (e.g. `"INVTYPE_HEAD"`), or
  `""` for non-equippable items.
- `icon` is a path string (`"Interface\\Icons\\..."`), matching what the
  rest of the 1.12 API returns. Modern WoW returns a numeric fileID here,
  but 1.12 has no fileID system, so a path is the only meaningful value.
- `classID` / `subClassID` are the raw enum integers (e.g. `2`, `7` for
  one-handed swords).

```lua
local id, type, subtype, equipLoc, icon, classID, subClassID
    = C_Item.GetItemInfoInstant(6948)  -- Hearthstone
-- type="Miscellaneous", subtype="Junk", equipLoc="",
-- icon="Interface\\Icons\\INV_Misc_Rune_01", classID=15, subClassID=0
```

The actual class/subclass values reflect 1.12.1's data, which differs from
modern WoW. For example, vanilla had no Cloth subclass under Trade Goods —
Silk Cloth lives at `(7, 0)` in this client, not the modern `(7, 5)`.

### `C_EventUtils.IsEventValid(eventName)`

Returns `true` if the named event exists in the engine's event-name table
and can be registered for, `false` otherwise. Equivalent to the modern
function of the same name; useful for addons that gate code behind feature
detection (e.g. registering for events that exist in some client builds
but not others).

```lua
if C_EventUtils.IsEventValid("PLAYER_LOGIN") then ... end       -- true
if C_EventUtils.IsEventValid("COMBAT_LOG_EVENT") then ... end   -- false (added in 3.x)
```

The check walks the engine's static event-name table at runtime, so it
sees events added by **any** loaded DLL that injects names by overwriting
`.rdata` strings in place — for example, on a Turtle WoW client running
SuperWoWhook, `IsEventValid("UNIT_CASTEVENT")` returns `true` because
SuperWoWhook patches the binary's event names with its own. This matches
what `frame:RegisterEvent` will actually accept, which is what addon code
needs to know.

### `GetSpellInfo(spellID)`

Returns the same nine values as 3.3.5's `GetSpellInfo`, for **any** spell ID
— including spells the player has not learned. Stock 1.12 has no
`GetSpellInfo` Lua function at all (only `GetSpellName`/`GetSpellTexture`,
both of which take a spellbook *slot* rather than an ID), so addons that
need spell metadata for arbitrary IDs (raid frames, debuff trackers, aura
libraries) currently can't get it.

Returns `name, rank, icon, cost, isFunnel, powerType, castTime, minRange,
maxRange`. All read directly from `Spell.dbc` (with `SpellIcon.dbc`,
`SpellCastTimes.dbc`, and `SpellRange.dbc` for the indirected fields). Cast
time is in milliseconds; ranges are floats in yards. `isFunnel` is a real
boolean (`true`/`false`), matching 3.3.5's behavior. Returns `nil` if the
spell ID is out of range.

```lua
local name, rank, icon = GetSpellInfo(133)  -- Fireball Rank 1
-- name="Fireball", rank="Rank 1", icon="Spell\\Fire\\..."
```

## Global

The DLL also defines a Lua global `CLASSIC_API_VERSION` once FrameScript has
booted, which addons can use to detect that the DLL is loaded and which
version is in use.

## Installation

Use [VanillaFixes](https://github.com/hannesmann/vanillafixes) to load the
DLL.

1. Install VanillaFixes if it isn't already.
2. Copy `ClassicAPI.dll` into your game directory.
3. Add `ClassicAPI.dll` to `dlls.txt`.
4. Launch the game with `VanillaFixes.exe`.

## Building

Requires CMake (3.10+) and an MSVC toolchain that can target 32-bit Windows.
WoW.exe is x86, so the DLL must be built as Win32; an x64 build will not
load.

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive   # fetches MinHook
cmake -B build -A Win32
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The output is `build/Release/ClassicAPI.dll`.

To stamp a version into `CLASSIC_API_VERSION`, pass `-DCLASSICAPI_TAG=vX.Y.Z`
at configure time; the value exposed to Lua will be `X*10000 + Y*100 + Z`.
