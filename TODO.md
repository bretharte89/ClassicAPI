# ClassicAPI — TODO

Candidates for new DLL functions, prioritized. All are things the
[!!!ClassicAPI](C:\WoW\FrostmourneClient\Interface\AddOns\!!!ClassicAPI) Lua
addon polyfills badly, hackily, or not at all, and where engine access is the
right answer.

## ~~1. `C_QuestLog.IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(questID)`~~ — NOT FEASIBLE in 1.12

The original TODO note ("engine maintains a completed-quests bitfield in
client memory") was based on 3.3.5 / WotLK semantics. Vanilla 1.12 has no
equivalent: neither `QueryQuestsCompleted` nor `GetQuestsCompleted`
exists, the protocol has no `CMSG_QUERY_QUESTS_COMPLETED`, and the
client doesn't track historical completions. The polyfill at
`Util/C_QuestLog.lua:5-8` works on Frostmourne (3.3.5a) where those
functions exist; on the 1.12 Octo client they're absent.

Servers that want to expose this in 1.12 (notably Turtle WoW) do it
via the `CHAT_MSG_ADDON` channel — the addon sends `.queststatus` over
guild/whisper chat and the server replies with addon-channel messages
the addon parses. Fundamentally async, server-specific, and requires
SavedVariables-style persistence across sessions to amortize the
round-trip — all of which belong on the Lua side, not in this DLL.
There's nothing the DLL can usefully add here.

## ~~2. `C_Spell.GetSpellDescription(spellID)`~~ — DONE

Calls the engine's own spell-description formatter at `0x005075F0`,
which reads the description string from `Spell.dbc` (record `+0x228`,
locale-applied) and resolves `$s1`/`$s2`/`$o1`/`$d`-style placeholders
character-by-character. 8 callers in the engine (spell tooltip builder,
talent UI, trainer, etc.); we mirror the simplest one's args
(`contextFlag=0` = "no caster scaling, base-rank values"). Output goes
into a 1024-byte caller-provided buffer that the helper null-terminates.

The interesting find: I expected the description to need a CGUnit
context for substitution, but the engine has a "no scaling" code path
that produces `"14 to 22 Fire damage"` (Fireball Rank 1's actual base
range) without any unit reference. That's the right semantic for
"describe this spell" — modern WoW behaves the same when called outside
a unit context.

Side note: a global at `0x00BE0B80` is the formatter's parser cursor
(it walks the description string char-by-char, advancing the cursor in
place). It's set and managed entirely inside the helper — callers don't
touch it. Lua C functions are single-threaded, so the global state is
safe to share with whatever else might call the formatter (it's all on
the same thread).

See [src/spell/Description.cpp](src/spell/Description.cpp) and the
`FUN_FORMAT_SPELL_DESCRIPTION` block in [src/Offsets.h](src/Offsets.h)
for the full calling convention (8-arg `__fastcall`).

## ~~3. `C_Item.IsBound` / `isBound` from `GetContainerItemInfo`~~ — DONE

Implemented as `C_Item.IsBound(itemLocation)`. Reads the soulbound bit
(`ITEM_FIELD_FLAGS` bit 0) directly off the CGItem's UpdateField
descriptor — no scan-tooltip hack, no string comparison. Accepts the
modern `{equipmentSlotIndex=N}` and `{bagID=B, slotIndex=S}` location
shapes. See [src/item/Bound.cpp](src/item/Bound.cpp) for the soulbound
read; the slot-resolution chain it depends on lives in
[src/item/Location.cpp](src/item/Location.cpp).

## ~~4. `GetSpellInfo` for unlearned spells~~ — DONE

Implemented as the global `GetSpellInfo(spellID)`. Returns the full 9-tuple
matching 3.3.5 semantics, including `true`/`false` for `isFunnel` (verified
against the 3.3.5 client). See [src/SpellInfo.cpp](src/SpellInfo.cpp).

## ~~5. `GetServerTime()`~~ — DONE

Reads year/month/day/hour/minute from the engine's game-time struct at
`0x00CE8538` (populated by `SMSG_LOGIN_VERIFY_WORLD` /
`SMSG_LOGIN_SETTIMESPEED` and advanced by the internal tick handler)
and converts via `_mkgmtime` to a Unix epoch timestamp.

The interesting find: the engine has its own "to seconds since epoch"
helper at `0x00642320` that I almost reused — but decoding the magic
constant `0xC22E4507` after the `_mkgmtime` call revealed the helper
divides the result by `86400` (seconds in a day), so it returns
**days-since-epoch**, not seconds. Rolled our own `_mkgmtime` call
instead.

The 1.12 wire protocol carries time at minute granularity — there are
no seconds in `SMSG_LOGIN_SETTIMESPEED`'s packed gametime field — so
the engine's stored hour/minute steps once per minute. To make the
returned timestamp tick every second (which is what `GetServerTime`
callers actually need), we interpolate within the minute using
`GetTickCount`: whenever the engine's minute changes, we anchor to the
current tick and add `(now - anchor) / 1000` for subsequent calls. The
cold-start value is off by 0..59 seconds since we have no way to know
how far into a minute the engine is the first time we observe it, but
after the first minute rollover the anchor lands at the boundary and
the timestamp is accurate for the rest of the session.

See [src/time/Server.cpp](src/time/Server.cpp) and
`VAR_GAMETIME_STRUCT` / `OFF_GAMETIME_*` in
[src/Offsets.h](src/Offsets.h).

## ~~6. `C_QuestLog.GetTitleForQuestID(questID)`~~ — DONE

Reads the title out of the quest static-info cache at offset `+0x9C`
(inline null-terminated C string within the data block returned by the
cache's `_GetRecord`). Title-offset derivation: traced from the engine's
own quest-log title path at `0x004DF180`, which calls `_GetRecord` and
then does `add eax, 0x9C; ret` — the result is fed directly to
`lua_pushstring`, so `+0x9C` is the C string itself, not a pointer.

The original TODO note "engine has the title in `Quest.dbc`" turned out
to be wrong — there is no `Quest.dbc` in 1.12 (only `QuestInfo.dbc` for
reward types and `QuestSort.dbc` for category headers). All quest static
data is server-authoritative, fetched via `SMSG_QUEST_QUERY_RESPONSE` and
held in the runtime cache at `0x00C0E1B0`. The "async dance" the polyfill
does is the unavoidable cost of that — though now it's just one call to
`C_QuestLog.RequestLoadQuestByID` plus an `OnEvent` listener instead of
a hidden tooltip and a 180-second timeout.

See [src/quest/Title.cpp](src/quest/Title.cpp) and the shared cache
helper at [src/quest/Cache.h](src/quest/Cache.h). The data-block field
offsets (currently just `+0x9C` for title) live in `Cache.h` alongside
the `Lookup`/`Peek` wrappers, so additional cached fields like
description and objectives can be added there as we trace them.

## 7. `UnitAuraBySlot` / `UnitAuraSlots` — medium

Lua addon stubs these out entirely (commented as needing `LibAura`), so
`AuraUtil.ForEachAura` is broken in the addon as written. The per-unit aura
array is in memory; `UnitAura(idx)` already iterates it. Adding slot-stable
accessors is a thin wrapper over the same internal call. Worth doing because
modern addon code assumes these exist.

References: `Util/Aura.lua:311-321` (commented out), `Util/AuraUtil.lua:42-67`.

## ~~8. `GetItemInfo` for uncached items~~ — DONE (via #12 + #13)

The "cache-fill path with a proper async callback so addons stop polling
on a frame timer" goal landed as the request/event pair below:

- **#12** ships `C_Item.IsItemDataCachedByID(item)` /
  `C_Item.RequestLoadItemDataByID(item)` (and the ItemLocation
  variants), wrapping the engine's existing
  `DBCache_ItemStats_C_GetRecord` at `0x55BA30` with a non-NULL callback
  to trigger the SMSG_ITEM_QUERY_SINGLE network fetch.
- **#13** ships `ITEM_DATA_LOAD_RESULT(itemID, success)`, fired from our
  `__stdcall` callback when the engine drops the response into the
  cache (or synchronously if it was already loaded).

Together those replace the polyfill's 180-second polling frame
(`ItemEventListener` in `Util/ItemUtil.lua:254-372`) — addons can now
fire `RequestLoadItemDataByID(id)` and listen for
`ITEM_DATA_LOAD_RESULT` instead.

A single `GetItemInfo(item)` that "returns nil and triggers a load" in
one call (matching modern WoW's `GetItemInfo` semantics for uncached
items) would be a thin convenience wrapper on top, but the modern
preferred pattern is exactly the request/event pair we have, so it's
not pursued separately.

## ~~9. `C_Item.GetItemInfoInstant(item)`~~ — DONE (not in original list)

The always-available subset of `GetItemInfo` — fields that depend only on
classification, not on player-specific state. Accepts itemID or
`item:NNN` link strings (full chat links work too); returns nil for
uncached items rather than blocking on a server query. See
[src/item/Info.cpp](src/item/Info.cpp). Reading `ItemSubClass.dbc` was the
fiddly bit (parallel-storage hack at `+0x00`/`+0x04` for compound-key
lookup, plus a verbose→short locale-name fallback chain) — full notes in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and [src/Offsets.h](src/Offsets.h).

## ~~10. `C_Item.GetItemID(itemLocation)`~~ — DONE (not in original list)

Returns the itemID for the item at a given equipment slot or bag/slot
tuple. Useful as the input to `GetItemInfoInstant`/`GetItemInfo` when you
only know which slot an item came from. Required factoring out the shared
slot-resolution code from `IsBound` into [src/item/Location.cpp](src/item/Location.cpp);
the GetItemID-specific bit (one extra deref) lives in
[src/item/ID.cpp](src/item/ID.cpp). The non-obvious part: the itemID
isn't in the CGItem's UpdateField descriptor (its `OBJECT_FIELD_ENTRY`
slot is empirically 0), but in a separate instance block at `CGItem+0x08`.

## ~~11. `C_EventUtils.IsEventValid(eventName)`~~ — DONE (not in original list)

Walks the engine's static event-name table at `0x00BE11D8` and returns
`true` if any populated slot contains the queried name. See
[src/event/Util.cpp](src/event/Util.cpp). The interesting bit: third-party
DLLs (notably SuperWoWhook on Turtle clients) inject custom events by
**overwriting `.rdata` event-name strings in place** rather than appending
to the table — so a runtime walk picks up their additions for free. Full
notes in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## ~~12. `C_Item.IsItemDataCached*` / `RequestLoadItemData*`~~ — DONE (not in original list)

Wraps the engine's existing client-side item cache (`_GetRecord` at
`0x55BA30`, `requestIfMissing` flag). Both `ByID` and ItemLocation
variants ship. See [src/item/Data.cpp](src/item/Data.cpp).

## ~~13. `ITEM_DATA_LOAD_RESULT` event~~ — DONE

Fires with `(itemID, success)` when an item finishes loading after a
`RequestLoadItemData*` call (or synchronously when the data was already
cached). See [src/event/Custom.cpp](src/event/Custom.cpp) for the
custom-event plumbing and [src/item/Data.cpp](src/item/Data.cpp) for
the wiring to the cache callback.

The investigation needed three engine pieces nobody had documented:

- **Dispatcher** at `0x00703F50` — `__cdecl void(int eventID, const char *fmt, ...)`,
  149 callers, indexes the table at `[0xCEEF68] + id*16`, walks the
  subscriber chain. Format is printf-style (`%s`, `%d`, `%u`, `%f`); no
  bool code, pass `%d` with 0/1.
- **Registration table** at `[0xCEEF68]` (count at `[0xCEEF64]`),
  16-byte entries, name at `+0x00`, subscriber chain head at `+0x0C`.
  `Frame::RegisterEvent` at `0x00702140` strcmps event names against
  this table.
- **Teardown landmine.** `FrameScript_Initialize`'s reload path
  (`0x00701A40`) calls `SMemFree(entry.name)` on every entry; our static
  literals are not Storm-allocated and trip the safety check. There's a
  NULL-name shortcut (`jz` at `0x00701A45`) so we null our entries
  before the engine sees them.

Full notes in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) under "Firing a custom event
end-to-end".

## ~~14. `C_QuestLog.RequestLoadQuestByID` + `QUEST_DATA_LOAD_RESULT`~~ — DONE (not in original list)

Fires `QUEST_DATA_LOAD_RESULT(questID, success)` when quest static info
(description, objectives, reward text) finishes loading. Synchronously
fired when the questID was already in the client cache; asynchronously
fired after `SMSG_QUEST_QUERY_RESPONSE` when the engine has to round-trip.

Implemented as a near-direct mirror of `Item::Data`: the quest cache
`_GetRecord` at `0x00562A40` has the same five-arg shape and the same
`callback != NULL` gate as the item cache `_GetRecord`. The interesting
investigation was confirming that `[0x00BB7480]` (passed as the cache
key in `Script_GetQuestLogQuestText`) is a *questID*, not a struct
pointer — verified by tracing the load site at `0x004DEF5D` back through
`mov eax, [esi + 0x00BB71C0]`, which reads field +0 of a quest log
entry (= questID per the quest log struct). The cache is then keyed by
questID just like the item cache is keyed by itemID.

See [src/quest/Data.cpp](src/quest/Data.cpp) and "Quest static-info
cache" in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). The custom-event plumbing
([src/event/Custom.cpp](src/event/Custom.cpp)) is shared with
`ITEM_DATA_LOAD_RESULT` — no new infrastructure needed.

## ~~15. `GetFactionInfoByID` / `GetFactionIDByIndex`~~ — DONE (not in original list)

`GetFactionInfoByID(factionID)` returns the same 11 values as
`GetFactionInfo(factionIndex)` keyed by factionID — implemented as a thin
wrapper that walks the engine's index→ID resolver at `0x004D5FA0` to find
the displayed-list index for the requested ID, then replaces Lua arg 1 and
tail-calls `Script_GetFactionInfo` (`0x004D64F0`). Only works for factions
the player has rep with, matching modern WoW's semantics.

`GetFactionIDByIndex(factionIndex)` exposes the same resolver directly —
returns the factionID for real entries, `0` for headers (normalizing the
engine's mix of `0` for "Other" and `-1` for "Inactive"), `nil` for OOB.
Modern WoW (5.0+, including Classic Era 1.15.x) returns this as the 14th
value of `GetFactionInfo`, but 1.12-3.3.5 don't expose it at all.

See [src/faction/Info.cpp](src/faction/Info.cpp) and "Faction lookups" in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the resolver/dual-count details.

## ~~16. `C_Container.GetContainerItemID(bagIndex, slotIndex)`~~ — DONE

Shipped under the modern `C_Container.*` namespace (matching post-MoP
WoW). Wraps the existing bag→CGItem path: a new public
`Item::Location::ResolveBag(L, bagID, slotIndex)` exposes the bag
resolver that was previously private inside the table-shape
`Resolve()`, and a small `ItemIDFromCGItem` helper in
[src/item/ID.cpp](src/item/ID.cpp) factors out the CGItem → instance
block → itemID step now used by both `C_Item.GetItemID` and
`C_Container.GetContainerItemID`.

Note: ships under `C_Container` rather than as the historical legacy
global `GetContainerItemID` since the modern namespace is the canonical
home for bag/container APIs (the global was deprecated in 10.0). If
addons need the legacy global it's a one-line addition.

## ~~17. `GetItemIcon(itemID)` / `C_Item.GetItemIcon(itemLocation)` / `C_Item.GetItemIconByID(item)`~~ — DONE

Three Lua entry points that all share a `PushIconForItemID(L, itemID)`
helper in [src/item/Info.cpp](src/item/Info.cpp). The helper routes
through the existing `FetchItemRecord` (item cache) and `BuildIconPath`
(`ItemDisplayInfo.dbc` lookup at `+0x14`) — same code path
`GetItemInfoInstant` already runs, just stripped to the icon-only return.

The refactor that fell out: extracted `Item::ID::FromCGItem` (the
CGItem → instance-block → itemID step) into [src/item/ID.h](src/item/ID.h)
so both `Item::ID` (for `C_Item.GetItemID` and
`C_Container.GetContainerItemID`) and `Item::Info` (for
`C_Item.GetItemIcon`'s ItemLocation form) can share it. Was static-dup
across two files before this; now it's one definition.

Returns the path string (deviation from modern's `fileID:number` —
1.12 has no fileID system; same call-out as
`C_Spell.GetSpellTexture`'s docs).

## ~~18. `UnitGUID(unit)`~~ — DONE

Returns the unit's 64-bit GUID as `"0xHHHHHHHHLLLLLLLL"` (16 hex
digits, hi dword first). Reads `*(unit + OFF_UNIT_GUID_PTR)` to get
the 8-byte struct, formats with `snprintf`. Lives in
[src/unit/Identity.cpp](src/unit/Identity.cpp).

Two behavioral notes worth flagging in docs:

- **Vanilla format, not modern's prefix shape.** 1.12 GUIDs are plain
  64-bit integers (the `"Player-1234-..."` / `"Creature-0-..."`
  formatted GUIDs were a 6.0 addition). Addons backporting modern
  GUID parsers need to accept the `"0x..."` form.
- **Errors on totally-unknown unit tokens.** `ResolveUnitToken` itself
  raises `"Unknown unit name: <token>"` for strings outside the known
  unit-ID list. We don't suppress it — matches how every other 1.12
  unit-token function (`UnitName`, `UnitAffectingCombat`, etc.)
  behaves. Tokens that resolve to "no current unit" (e.g. `"target"`
  with nothing targeted) cleanly return nil via the GUID-is-zero
  short-circuit.

## ~~19. `IsPassiveSpell` / `C_Spell.IsSpellPassive`~~ — DONE

Reads `Attributes` (+0x18) bit 6 (`SPELL_ATTR_PASSIVE = 0x40`) off the
`Spell.dbc` record — same pattern [src/spell/Info.cpp](src/spell/Info.cpp)
already used for `isFunnel` (AttributesEx bit 6, on a different field).

Shipped both forms with shared `PushIsPassive` back-end:

- `IsPassiveSpell(spellID)` / `IsPassiveSpell(slot, bookType)` — the
  3.0-era global, supports both arg shapes via `ResolveLuaArgsToSpellID`
  (mirrors `GetSpellInfo` / `GetSpellLink`).
- `C_Spell.IsSpellPassive(spellID)` — the modern 10.0 form (word order
  flipped during the `C_Spell` namespace migration). spellID-only.

## ~~20. `GetSpellLink(spellID)` / `C_Spell.GetSpellLink(spellID)`~~ — DONE

Builds `|cff71d5ff|Hspell:ID:0|h[Name]|h|r` via `snprintf` after a
single `Spell.dbc` name read. The trailing `:0` after the spellID
matches modern's hyperlink shape so addons backporting from later
expansions can `gsub` with the standard `|Hspell:(%d+):` pattern; 1.12
ignores it during link parsing.

Both forms shipped:

- `GetSpellLink(spellID)` and `GetSpellLink(slot, bookType)` (global)
  return `(link, spellID)`. The slot-and-bookType overload reuses the
  same `Spell::Lookup::ResolveLuaArgsToSpellID` helper as
  `GetSpellInfo`.
- `C_Spell.GetSpellLink(spellID)` (table) returns just the link string
  — the caller already had the spellID on hand.

See [src/spell/Info.cpp](src/spell/Info.cpp) `Script_GetSpellLink` /
`Script_C_GetSpellLink` and the `BuildSpellLink` helper.

## ~~21. `InCombatLockdown()`~~ — DONE

Reads `UNIT_FLAG_IN_COMBAT` (bit 19, `0x00080000`) of the player's
UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS — same bit `Script_UnitAffectingCombat` at
`0x00517E4A`-`0x517E5C` tests via `mov eax, [fields+0xA0]; shr eax, 19;
test al, 1`. Modern WoW's "lockdown" gates secure-frame UI changes;
1.12 has no secure-frame system, so the function reduces to a plain
"is the player in combat" check (equivalent to
`UnitAffectingCombat("player")` but skips the unit-token resolution).

Lives in [src/unit/Combat.cpp](src/unit/Combat.cpp) — first occupant of
the new `src/unit/` directory. Future unit-flag accessors
(`UnitIsAFK`, `UnitIsDND`, `UnitIsFeignDeath`, `UnitClassBase`, etc.)
can land alongside without polluting the per-domain Lua-namespace
directories.

## 22. `UnitClassBase(unit)` — easy

Locale-independent class file string (`"WARRIOR"`, `"MAGE"`, etc.).
Modern addons use this for class detection because `UnitClass` returns
a localized name. Read from `UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0` (the byte field that
holds class/race/gender/power-type), then map to one of the 9 vanilla
class strings. We already know the unit descriptor lives at
`[unit + 0x110]` (see `UnitPlayerControlled` discovery for
`GetInventoryItemID`).

## 23. `GetItemSpell(item)` — easy

Returns the on-use spell name + spellID for items that have one
(potions, trinkets, scrolls). Reads ItemStats fields that we haven't
mapped yet — the `m_spellId[5]` array on the cached item record.
Combine the spellID with `GetSpellInfo` for the name.

## ~~24. `GetInventoryItemDurability(invSlot)` / `C_Container.GetContainerItemDurability(containerIndex, slotIndex)`~~ — DONE

Returns `(current, max)` durability for the player's equipped item or
bag/bank slot, or nothing if the slot is empty or the item has no
durability concept (consumables, materials, rings, trinkets, shirts,
tabards). Both forms shipped:

- `GetInventoryItemDurability(invSlot)` — character-pane equipment slot
  (1-based, 1..19). Player-only by design, matches modern API; the
  original TODO line had `(unit, slot)` but modern
  `GetInventoryItemDurability` takes only the slot.
- `C_Container.GetContainerItemDurability(containerIndex, slotIndex)` —
  bag/bank slot. Goes through `Item::Location::ResolveBag` →
  `PackBagSlot` → `GetItemBySlot`, same chain
  `C_Container.GetContainerItemID` already used.

Both share the inner `PushDurabilityForItem` helper — only the
CGItem-resolution path differs. Reads ITEM_FIELD_DURABILITY (+0xA0) and
ITEM_FIELD_MAXDURABILITY (+0xA4) off the CGItem descriptor at `+0x114`
— the same descriptor [src/item/Bound.cpp](src/item/Bound.cpp) reads
FLAGS from. Field offsets verified by decoding
`Script_GetInventoryItemBroken` at `0x004C8590`, which tests
`[descriptor+0x3C] & 0x08` for the broken flag bit AND
`[descriptor+0xA4] > 0 && [descriptor+0xA0] == 0` as a fallback.
Modern semantics confirmed against 3.3.5's
`Script_GetInventoryItemDurability` at `0x005EA170`: returns nothing
(0 values) when max is 0.

See [src/item/Durability.cpp](src/item/Durability.cpp).

## ~~25. `FindSpellBookSlotByID(spellID)`~~ — DONE

Walks the player spellbook at `0x00B700F0` first, then the pet
spellbook at `0x00B6F098`, returning `(slot, bookType)` for the first
match. Bounds at `SPELLBOOK_MAX_SLOTS = 0x400` (the engine's own cap
in `Script_GetSpellName`); empty/zero entries past the populated count
are skipped naturally since spellID 0 doesn't match any positive
input. Result feeds directly into the slot-and-bookType API surface
(`GetSpellName`, `GameTooltip:SetSpell`, etc.).

Logic added to [src/spell/Lookup.cpp](src/spell/Lookup.cpp) as
`Spell::Lookup::FindSpellbookSlot`; the Lua C function lives next to
the other spell registrations in [src/spell/Info.cpp](src/spell/Info.cpp).

## 26. `IsEquippableItem(item)` — trivial

Boolean: can the item be equipped at all? One-line check: fetch the
ItemStats record (we already have `Item::Info::FetchItemRecord`) and
test `m_inventoryType > 0`. The INVTYPE field is at
`OFF_ITEMSTATS_INVENTORY_TYPE = 0x2C`, already wired up.

## 27. `IsEquippedItem(item)` — easy

Boolean: is the item currently equipped on the player? Walk equipment
slots 1..19 via the same `Item::Location::ResolveEquipmentSlot` chain
the existing accessors use, then `Item::ID::FromCGItem` for each one
and compare to the input itemID. Returns true on first match.

## ~~28. `C_Item.GetItemCount(itemInfo, [includeBank], [includeUses])`~~ — DONE (partial — `includeUses` deferred)

Total count of an item across the player's bags (and optionally bank).
Walks bags 0..4 always (live walk via `Item::Location::ResolveBag`).
Stack count read directly from `ITEM_FIELD_STACK_COUNT` at descriptor
+0x20 — verified by decoding `Script_GetContainerItemInfo`
(`0x004F9670`), which does `mov eax, [esi+0x114]; fild [eax+0x20]` for
the count return.

**Bank works cold** — no banker visit required. The 1.12 server sends
bank inventory at login (verified empirically on Turtle WoW: fresh
WoW.exe launch + cleared WDB folder shows GUIDs already populated in
main bank slots 39..62 with the gate at `VAR_BANK_GATE_GUID = 0`).
The engine's `GetItemBySlot` (`0x006228A0`) gates bank slots 39..68
on a non-zero banker-GUID at `0x00BDD038` — set when bank window
opens, cleared when it closes — but the underlying GUID data in
`invMgr+0x04` is always present from session start.

Bank-walk path bypasses the gate by reading GUIDs directly out of
the player invMgr's slot array and resolving each via
`FUN_OBJECT_RESOLVE_BY_GUID = 0x00468460` (same function the engine
itself calls inside `GetItemBySlot`, just without the gate wrapper).
Bank bags (slots 63..68) are followed via the bag's vtable +0x10 to
get its own invMgr, then walked by the same direct-read path. Cold
count of a bank-only item now works from login without ever
approaching a banker — confirmed in-game.

The 1.12 STACK_COUNT field index (0x8) puts it *before* the contained/
creator GUIDs, **opposite** the more commonly documented vanilla
layout (which has STACK_COUNT at index 0xE = +0x38). Trust the
binary: 0x20 is what the engine itself reads, and our test (cross-
checked against a manual `GetContainerItemInfo` walk) confirms it.

`includeUses` (charges-multiplier mode) is **accepted but currently
ignored** — both `true` and `false` produce the same value. Modern
semantics multiply each match by the item's spell-charges count (a
stack of 5 wands × 50 charges → 250). To finish: verify
`ITEM_FIELD_SPELL_CHARGES` offset (suspected +0x40 = field index
0x10 in 1.12's layout) by reading from a charged item's descriptor
and confirming against the cast counter.

See [src/item/Count.cpp](src/item/Count.cpp).

## ~~29. `C_Item.GetItemFamily(item)`~~ — DONE

Returns the BagFamily bitmask for the item, or `nil` if it isn't in
the cache. Reads `m_bagFamily` at +0x1D0 on the cached `ItemStats_C`
record (offset verified by decoding the engine's own
`GetItemBagFamily(itemID)` helper at `0x005DA050`, which calls
`_GetRecord` then `mov eax, [eax+0x1D0]; ret`).

**Encoding-shift gotcha.** 1.12 stores the raw 1-based BagFamily ID
(`arrow=1, bullet=2, soul shard=3, herb=6, …`); modern WoW (Wrath+)
flipped to the bitmask form `1 << (ID-1)` (`arrow=0x1, bullet=0x2,
soul shard=0x4, herb=0x20, …`). Addons backporting from later
expansions expect the bitmask, so we convert on the way out via
`bitmask = id ? (1 << (id - 1)) : 0`. Verified empirically on Turtle
WoW: Soul Shard (item 6265) reads raw 3 from the cache, returns 4
(`1 << 2`) to Lua callers — matches modern.

**Vanilla data sparsity.** 1.12 server data (at least on Turtle WoW)
populates `m_bagFamily` reliably on **individual loot items** but
leaves it 0 on most **bag containers** themselves. Soul Pouch,
Enchanting Bag, Herb Pouch all return 0 even though their
classification clearly implies a family. Only Light Quiver is
populated among the bags we tested. This means
`GetContainerNumFreeSlots`'s second return is reliable only for
quivers; for general bag categorization, addons should fall back to
checking `(class, subClass)` from `GetItemInfoInstant`. The
`GetItemFamily` *item* path is solid for routing loot to the right
specialty bag.

See [src/item/Info.cpp](src/item/Info.cpp).

## ~~30. `IsSpellKnown(spellID, [isPet])`~~ — DONE

Strict spellbook walk via `Spell::Lookup::FindSpellbookSlot`, filtered
by the requested book type. Returns true only when the spell is in
the player's (or pet's) spellbook UI arrays — does NOT cover talent
passives, profession recipes, or anything else that's "known" but not
displayable as a spellbook button.

### How we caught the bug pre-ship

I initially implemented `IsSpellKnown` using the same bitmap as
`IsPlayerSpell`, on the (wrong) assumption that the two functions
were equivalent in 1.12 since the bitmap was the engine's
authoritative knowledge store. The user pushed back: "I feel like
[`IsSpellKnown`] is not as powerful as `IsPlayerSpell`."

Cross-binary lookup confirmed: 3.3.5's `Script_IsSpellKnown` at
`0x0053C3A0` calls an inner helper at `0x0053B4E0` that does a strict
**spellbook array walk** (`[0x00BE6D88]` for player, `[0x00BE7D98]`
for pet) — not a bitmap. Modern WoW deliberately splits the two
functions: `IsSpellKnown` is the strict "spellbook button" check,
`IsPlayerSpell` (added in 5.0) is the broad "any kind of known"
query. We need both with their respective semantics.

### Behavior table (verified in-game)

| Spell type             | `IsPlayerSpell` | `IsSpellKnown` |
|------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Trained class ability  | true            | true           |
| Active talent grant    | true            | true           |
| Passive talent         | true            | **false**      |
| Profession recipe      | true            | **false**      |

Same split as modern WoW. The cross-binary technique paid off again
— caught the wrong implementation before it shipped.

See [src/spell/Info.cpp](src/spell/Info.cpp) and the worked example
in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#cross-binary-reference--finding-112-implementations-via-newer-clients).

## ~~31. Unit flag bundle: `UnitIsAFK` / `UnitIsDND` / `UnitIsFeignDeath`~~ — DONE (FeignDeath ships untested)

All three shipped in [src/unit/Flags.cpp](src/unit/Flags.cpp):

- **`UnitIsAFK(unit)`** / **`UnitIsDND(unit)`** — read PLAYER_FLAGS at
  `[unit + 0xE68] + 0x08`, bits 1 (AFK = `0x02`) and 2 (DND = `0x04`).
  Works for any player-controlled unit (local self, target, party,
  raid, inspect targets). Gated on `UNIT_FLAG_PLAYER_CONTROLLED` first
  to avoid the crash hazard on creatures (where `+0xE68` is uninitialized
  garbage).
- **`UnitIsFeignDeath(unit)`** — reads `UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS` bit 29
  (`0x20000000`) at `[m_objectFields + 0xA0]`. Untested — no Hunter
  available — but the value is the standard vanilla emulator constant.

**Where PLAYER_FLAGS lives — and the misleading first guess.** The
field index `0x8A` (= byte offset `0x228` in m_objectFields) is the
"natural" place to look (matches modern WoW's broadcast UpdateField),
but vanilla 1.12 *doesn't* broadcast PLAYER_FLAGS as a UpdateField —
reading `[descriptor + 0x228]` returns a different field entirely.
The actual storage is in a CGPlayer-side sub-struct at `[unit + 0xE68]`,
shared with the visible-items table at `+0x118`. Verified by
disassembling 1.12's nameplate AFK-prefix renderer at `0x005EC9E0`,
which is the *only* C-level code in stock 1.12 that decorates
nameplates with `<AFK>` — and which works for any unit, contrary to
the initial reading where I thought the JNE went the other way.

**Vanilla nameplate display.** Stock 1.12 shows `<AFK>` over **any**
nearby player's head, not just yourself — the function at `0x005EC9E0`
checks `[unit + 0xE68] + 0x08` bit 1 universally and only special-cases
the local player when a global at `[0x00B6E5CC]` is set (probably a
"hide my own AFK indicator" preference toggle). User confirmed in-game
on a non-Turtle stock 1.12.1 server.

## 32. `IsCurrentSpell(spellID)` — easy

Boolean: is the player currently casting / channeling this spell?
Needs a runtime "current cast spellID" global the engine maintains
for the spell-button UI. Likely lives near the cast bar state — a
short trace through `Script_GetCurrentCastingInfo`-style functions
(if any exist) or the cast-bar timer logic. Worth doing because
modern action-bar addons gate "highlight the active button" on this.

## 33. `C_Reputation.*` cluster — easy

Modern table-shape and ID-based variants of the existing reputation
API. Most are thin wrappers around what we already have — useful for
addons backporting modern Lua-side code that prefers the C_Reputation
namespace.

- **`C_Reputation.SetWatchedFactionByID(factionID)`** — walks the
  faction-index resolver to find the index for `factionID`, then calls
  the engine's `Script_SetWatchedFactionIndex`. Same approach as our
  `GetFactionInfoByID`. Highest-value of the cluster — RepBuddy
  explicitly takes the fast path here when available
  (`Util/RepBuddy.lua:286`).
- **`C_Reputation.SetWatchedFactionByIndex(index)`** — modern alias
  for `SetWatchedFactionIndex`. One-line registration that points to
  the engine function via our existing wrapper.
- **`C_Reputation.GetFactionDataByIndex(index)`** /
  **`GetFactionDataByID(factionID)`** — table-returning variants of
  `GetFactionInfo` / `GetFactionInfoByID`. Pack the existing 11-tuple
  into named fields (`name`, `description`, `reaction`, `barMin`,
  `barMax`, `currentStanding`, `atWarWith`, `canToggleAtWar`,
  `isHeader`, `isCollapsed`, `hasRep`, `factionID`).
- **`C_Reputation.GetWatchedFactionData()`** — table form of
  `GetWatchedFactionInfo` (which 1.12 has natively).

All five share the same faction-index resolver
(`FUN_RESOLVE_FACTION_INDEX`) and walk pattern we already use in
`src/faction/Info.cpp`. Could land as a single `src/faction/CInfo.cpp`
adding the C_Reputation registrations.

## 34. `C_DateAndTime.GetSecondsUntilDailyReset()` — easy

Modern API returns seconds until the next "daily reset" — vanilla 1.12
has no daily reset concept (no daily quests, no LFG cooldown, etc.)
but the closest sensible analog is **seconds until midnight server
time**, which is what addons like RepBuddy actually use this for
(`Util/RepBuddy.lua:185` — refreshes the day's earned-rep snapshot).

Implementation: read server hour/minute from whatever global vanilla's
`Script_GetGameTime` (`0x...` — find via `raw_globals.txt`) reads,
then compute `(24-hour)*3600 - minute*60`. Returns an int. If the
server hour can't be resolved (e.g. before first time-sync packet),
fall back to `86400` (a full day) — better than 0, which would make
addons think a reset just happened and wipe daily snapshots.

Could share infrastructure with #5 `GetServerTime` if we wire that up
first — if we have the server epoch, "seconds until next UTC midnight"
is `86400 - (epoch % 86400)`. Otherwise the GetGameTime path stands
alone.

## 35. `GetPlayerInfoByGUID(guid)` — multi-day, deferred

Modern Classic Era / 3.3.5 returns
`localizedClass, englishClass, localizedRace, englishRace, sex, name, realm`
for any GUID the engine knows about. **In 1.12 a partial backport is
straightforward; the full version requires building our own packet-cache
layer.** Investigated and parked.

### What 1.12 has

- **Active object manager** (`ClntObjMgrObjectPtr` at `0x00468460`,
  signature `__fastcall(typeMask, dbgStr, guid_lo, guid_hi, dbgCode) →
  CGObject_C *`, `ret 0xC`). Resolves a GUID to a CGObject *only if the
  object is currently active in the client* — your party, raid, target,
  mouseover, nearby visible players. Returns NULL otherwise.
  - For an active CGPlayer_C, race/class/sex are byte-packed in
    `UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0` at `[m_objectFields + 0x90]`
    (`m_objectFields = [unit + 0x110]`):
    - byte 0 = race, byte 1 = class, byte 2 = gender, byte 3 = power.
  - The player's name is reachable via the CGObject vftable's
    `GetName` slot (slot index ~28 per VanillaMinimapTracking's
    `CGObject_C_VfTable`).

- **NameCache** (instance at `0x00CE870C`, generic-cache class with
  init at `0x00760390`, allocator at `0x00760450`, entry-init helper
  at `0x006C6C90`). Entry size **0x38 bytes**, ~256 buckets initially.
  Layout (partial):
  - `+0x00..+0x07`: GUID (likely)
  - `+0x18`: state/flags (init = 3; bit 1 set = "in cache", bit 1 = ??)
  - `+0x1C`: free-list link
  - `+0x20..+0x2F`: ~16 bytes of payload — **fits a player name (≤12
    chars + null), nothing more**.
  - RTTI string `NameCache@@_KVCHashKeyGUID@@@@` at `0x00855EE3` confirms
    the GUID-keyed shape.

- The cache populator at `0x006C76A0` calls `ClntObjMgrObjectPtr` first
  and only allocates a NameCache entry if the GUID resolves to a
  CGObject with `[obj+0xD8] != 0`. **The engine's NameCache is not fed
  by SMSG_NAME_QUERY_RESPONSE** — it only caches names for objects we've
  already seen as live CGObjects. So even for offline guildies/friends,
  this cache is empty.

- **Friends/Guild/Who** caches do exist with GUID-bearing entries:
  friends list at `0x00C28168` (record fields `name@+0x04`, `level@+0x10`,
  `classID@+0x14`, `area@+0x18`), guild roster around `0x00C0E1EC`, who
  results count at `0x00C2A120`. These have **class but no race** — the
  SMSG_FRIEND_LIST and SMSG_GUILD_ROSTER wire formats simply don't carry
  race or sex.

### Two implementation paths

**A. Visible-only (1-2 hours, narrow coverage)**

Use `ClntObjMgrObjectPtr` + UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0 + vftable->GetName.
Returns the full 7-tuple for live CGPlayer_C objects, `nil` otherwise.
Realm is whatever global holds the realm name (single-realm in 1.12).
Class/race byte → string via static maps (1=Warrior … 11=Druid;
1=Human … 8=Troll). Useful for tooltip/raid-frame use cases that
already have the player resolvable.

**B. Full async cache (3-5 days)**

Build our own player-info cache fed by hooking SMSG_NAME_QUERY_RESPONSE
(opcode `0x51`, wire format `GUID(8) + name(cstring) + realm(cstring) +
race(u32) + sex(u32) + class(u32)`). Send CMSG_NAME_QUERY (`0x50`) for
cache misses. Fire `NAME_QUERY_DATA_LOAD_RESULT(guid, success)` event on
response (reuse `Event::Custom`).

Two unsolved unknowns make this multi-day:

1. **Where is opcode dispatch in 1.12?** No clean
   `Net::RegisterPacketHandler` analog has been located. If dispatch is
   a giant switch (likely), we'd hook the dispatcher itself or the
   per-opcode handler we identify by static analysis. Need substantial
   disassembly time.
2. **What's the send-packet primitive?** Have to find a `CDataStore`
   build + `CWorld::Send` analog and figure out the calling convention.

If we ever take the dependency on SuperWoWhook (already loaded in the
user's setup), it exposes `RegisterPacketHandler` and `SendPacket` as
its own DLL ABI — would short-circuit both unknowns. But that introduces
a hard dependency on a third-party DLL, contrary to ClassicAPI's design.

### Recommended starting point when this gets picked up

Path A (visible-only) lands quickly and covers the most common
"resolve a GUID I'm already looking at" use case. Document the
limitation prominently in the API doc. Defer Path B until either a
concrete addon need surfaces or we end up doing the network-layer
disassembly for another reason (e.g. a packet-driven feature like
`C_FriendList` or `BNGetFriendInfo` polyfilling).

## ~~36. `GetTalentSpellID(tabIndex, talentIndex[, rank])`~~ — DONE

Bridges the talent system to the spell system: once you have the
spellID, every spell API chains naturally (`GetSpellInfo`,
`C_Spell.GetSpellDescription`, `GameTooltip:SetSpellByID`,
`IsPassiveSpell`, `C_Spell.GetSpellLink`, …). 1.12's `GetTalentInfo`
returns `(name, icon, tier, column, currentRank, maxRank, ...)` — no
spellID — so addons used to have to maintain their own
`(class, tab, idx) → spellID` lookup tables.

Reads from the engine's per-tab talent arrays at `[0x00BDCD28]`
(populated at login from `Talent.dbc` filtered by the player's class),
not Talent.dbc directly. Each `TabInfo *` exposes:

- `+0x00` TalentTab.dbc rowID
- `+0x04` pointsSpent
- `+0x08` numTalents
- `+0x0C` `TalentEntry *` array (stride `0x54`)

Each `TalentEntry`:

- `+0x00` talentID (Talent.dbc primary key)
- `+0x10..+0x33` `SpellRank[9]` (rank-N spellID at index N-1; vanilla
  uses 0..4, higher slots stay zero)

When `rank` is omitted, default = player's currentRank, derived by
delegating to `Script_GetTalentInfo` and reading its 5th return —
piggybacking on the engine's spell-knowledge logic. If currentRank is
0, falls back to rank 1.

### Two gotchas worth noting

1. **The engine's currentRank loop walks SpellRank backwards** — `lea
   edx, [ebx+0x30]` then `sub ecx, 4` per iteration, ending at +0x10.
   I initially read +0x30 as the start of `SpellRank[]`; it's actually
   the END (slot 9, always zero in vanilla). Confirmed empirically by
   a debug build returning 0 from +0x30 vs the right spellID from
   +0x10.

2. **Stock 1.12.1's `GetTalentInfo` returns 8 values, not the 6 I
   expected** based on naive disassembly. Reading the 5th return uses
   `stack[-(n - 4)]` (dynamic from the actual return count) instead of
   a hardcoded `stack[-2]`.

See [src/talent/Info.cpp](src/talent/Info.cpp) and the talent block
(`VAR_TALENT_TAB_*` / `OFF_TABINFO_*` / `OFF_TALENT_SPELL_RANK`) in
[src/Offsets.h](src/Offsets.h).

## 37. `GetSpellSchool(spellID)` — easy

Returns the spell's damage school as a 1-based index and locale-
independent string: `(schoolID, schoolName)` where `schoolName` is
one of `"Physical"`, `"Holy"`, `"Fire"`, `"Nature"`, `"Frost"`,
`"Shadow"`, `"Arcane"`. Modern `GetSchoolString(school)` does the
mapping; we'd expose both the raw ID and the string in one call.

`Spell.dbc` has the `SchoolMask` byte field (single dword, only one
bit set in 1.12 — multi-school is a TBC+ thing). Offset within the
record needs to be derived; the engine's `Script_GetSpellInfo` /
spell tooltip builder reads it.

Used by combat log breakdown addons, dispel logic (which schools your
class can dispel), resistance-aware aura libraries, and damage meter
school tagging. Currently addons either maintain hardcoded
spellID→school tables or scan tooltips for the first-line color tag.

## 38. `GetSpellRadius(spellID)` — easy

Returns the AOE radius in yards, or `nil` for non-AOE spells.
`Spell.dbc` has a `SpellRadiusIndex` field that points into
`SpellRadius.dbc` (instance at `0x00C0D7A8` per `docs/DBCs.md`,
already wired up via `VAR_SPELL_RANGE_RECORDS`-style helpers in
`src/spell/Info.cpp`).

Stride and field layout for `SpellRadius.dbc`: needs derivation
(should be `{id, radius_min, radius, radius_max}` per the public
schema, but verify). Sub-DBC lookup pattern matches what
`LookupSubRecord` already does in `Info.cpp` for icon / cast time /
range.

Useful for AOE damage trackers, ground-effect addons, and any aura
library that wants to render an indicator radius. Modern WoW exposes
this via `GetSpellRadius` (deprecated) or returns from
`C_Spell.GetSpellInfo`.

## ~~39. `GetFactionParentID(factionID)`~~ — DONE

Reads `Faction.dbc` `ParentFactionID` at record `+0x48` via the
existing `Faction::Info::FactionRecord` helper. Returns `0` for
top-level factions, `nil` for invalid IDs. Verified in-game:
`GetFactionParentID(72)` → 469 (Stormwind → Alliance Forces),
`GetFactionParentID(469)` → 0 (Alliance is top-level),
`GetFactionParentID(99999)` → nil.

See [src/faction/Info.cpp](src/faction/Info.cpp) and
`OFF_FACTION_PARENT_ID` in [src/Offsets.h](src/Offsets.h).

## 40. `UnitRaceBase(unit)` — easy

Sibling to TODO #22 `UnitClassBase` — locale-independent race string
(`"Human"`, `"Orc"`, `"Dwarf"`, `"NightElf"`, `"Scourge"`, `"Tauren"`,
`"Gnome"`, `"Troll"`). 1.12's `UnitRace(unit)` returns the localized
display name only; addons currently match against locale-specific
strings or maintain their own race-byte → name maps.

Read from `UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0` (byte 0 = race). Same `[unit + 0x110]`
descriptor path `InCombatLockdown` already uses (see
`OFF_UNIT_DESCRIPTOR` / `OFF_UNIT_FIELD_FLAGS` for the pattern). The
9 race strings are static — encode as a small table.

Modern WoW added `UnitRace`'s second return as the locale-independent
form in 5.0; we surface it via this distinct call rather than
modifying `UnitRace`'s 1.12 signature.

## 41. `GetActiveTalentGroup()` / `GetCurrentSpec()` — easy

Vanilla has no formal "spec" system but every class has 3 talent tabs
and the player always invests in one primarily. Returns the
1-based tab index (1, 2, or 3) of the tab with the most points spent,
or `0` if the player has no points spent at all (low-level
characters, or after a respec).

Trivial implementation: walk `GetNumTalentTabs()` (= 3), call
`GetTalentTabInfo(tab)` for each, compare `pointsSpent`. Pick max.
No DBC reads, no engine internals — pure Lua-equivalent computation
that's just easier to call than write inline every time.

Modern WoW's `GetSpecialization()` returns 1..4 for the player's
active spec. This is the closest 1.12 analog, useful for class
addons that want to render different UI per spec ("am I tanking?
healing? DPS?") without having to do the talent-counting dance
themselves.

## ~~42. `GetTalentIDByIndex(tabIndex, talentIndex)`~~ — DONE

Reads `TalentEntry+0x00` from the per-tab talent arrays. The
talentID-at-+0x00 offset was already confirmed empirically during
the GetTalentSpellID debug pass (`entryFirstDword=174` matched
Inner Focus's row ID), so this was a 5-line addition piggybacking
on the existing struct walk. Verified in-game:
`GetTalentIDByIndex(1, 9)` → 174,
`GetTalentIDByIndex(1, 1)` → 166.

Unblocks #43 `GameTooltip:SetTalentByID` whenever someone wants the
modern by-ID tooltip dispatcher.

See [src/talent/Info.cpp](src/talent/Info.cpp).

## 43. `GameTooltip:SetTalentByID(talentID)` — medium

Modern method that renders a talent tooltip from just a talentID —
the natural pair to #42 `GetTalentIDByIndex`. 1.12 has
`GameTooltip:SetTalent(tabIndex, talentIndex)` already (at
`0x00535170`, registry slot 34), but no by-ID variant.

Implementation: look up the Talent.dbc record by talentID, extract
the `(TabID, tier, column)`, reverse to a 1-based `(tab, idx)`
pair (re-using the same walk #42 / #36 use), then dispatch to the
existing `Script_GameTooltip_SetTalent` at `0x00535170`. The
existing function does all the heavy lifting (player-object
resolve, talent record read, tooltip line construction) — we're
just adapting the input shape.

The "reverse" mapping is the tricky part: Talent.dbc rows aren't
natively keyed by `(tab, idx)`; the visible order is computed at
display time. Same helper #42 uses, just inverted.

If we ship #42 first, this becomes a thin wrapper — the talentID →
`(tab, idx)` mapping is symmetric to #42's `(tab, idx)` → talentID.

## ~~44. `GameTooltip:SetItemByID(itemID)`~~ — DONE

snprintf the hyperlink string and dispatch to the existing
`Script_GameTooltip_SetHyperlink`. Same registration pattern as
`SetSpellByID`.

### Caching gotcha caught in testing

Initial test showed only the item *name*, not the full tooltip, for
arbitrary itemIDs. Cause: 1.12 lazy-loads item data into the
client-side cache (the same cache `C_Item.GetItemInfoInstant` reads).
Items the player has never encountered show only what's in the link
itself (the name) until the cache is populated via
`SMSG_ITEM_QUERY_SINGLE_RESPONSE`. This isn't a bug in our
implementation — it's the same behavior as modern's `SetItemByID`,
which also requires `C_Item.RequestLoadItemDataByID` first for
arbitrary IDs.

Documented the caveat in [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) with the
recommended `IsItemDataCachedByID` / `RequestLoadItemDataByID` /
`ITEM_DATA_LOAD_RESULT` pattern callers should follow.

See [src/item/Tooltip.cpp](src/item/Tooltip.cpp).

## ~~45. `GameTooltip:SetUnitAura(unit, index, [filter])`~~ — DONE

Pure dispatch wrapper. Branches on filter string (`"HARMFUL"` →
`SetUnitDebuff`, anything else → `SetUnitBuff`) and forwards via
the existing script function. `filter` defaults to helpful when
omitted, matching modern.

See [src/unit/Tooltip.cpp](src/unit/Tooltip.cpp) and the
`FUN_SCRIPT_GAMETOOLTIP_SET_UNIT_*` block in
[src/Offsets.h](src/Offsets.h).

## 46. `GameTooltip:SetFrameStack([showHidden])` — medium-large, deferred

Renders a tooltip listing the chain of frames at the mouse cursor,
sorted by strata + level. The 3.0+ debug-tooling primitive used by
Blizzard's `Blizzard_DebugTools` and every layout-debugging addon.

Our bundled `DebugTools/` backport already implements its own walk
over `EnumerateFrames()` (see the comment in
[DebugTools/DebugTools.lua](DebugTools/DebugTools.lua):
"No GameTooltip:SetFrameStack -- a basic walk over global frames is
used instead"). The Lua version works but is slow (thousands of
frames each call) and misses anonymous frames the engine sees but
doesn't expose to globals.

A C implementation would walk the engine's internal frame list
directly (faster, complete) and use the engine's hit-testing to
filter to frames actually at the cursor. Significant scope:

- Locate the engine's frame list (`CSimpleFrame::s_frameList` or
  similar) — not yet identified.
- Find the cursor hit-test path — engine has one for the click
  dispatcher, but locating it needs disassembly time.
- Strata/level sort.
- Format and feed into `GameTooltip:AddLine` — we don't currently
  call AddLine from our DLL, would need to add that path.

Skip until either the DebugTools backport's slowness becomes a real
pain point, or we end up doing frame-list disassembly for another
reason (e.g. exposing a `GetMouseFocus()` polyfill).

## ~~47. `IsPlayerSpell(spellID)`~~ — DONE

Single bitmap lookup at `[VAR_PLAYER_SPELL_BITMAP] = [0x00B710FC]`.
The engine maintains a dword bitmap with one bit per spellID — set
when the player learns a spell (any source: training, talent
investment, profession recipe, racial unlock, etc.) and cleared on
unlearn. We just consult the same bit the engine itself reads via
the helper at `0x0060C740`:

```cpp
return (bitmap[spellID >> 5] & (1 << (spellID & 31))) != 0;
```

### How we found it

The naive walk-based implementation (originally drafted) failed for
profession recipes — turns out vanilla 1.12's `VAR_PLAYER_SPELLBOOK`
arrays DON'T contain profession recipe spellIDs (verified
empirically: a tailor with Bolt of Linen Cloth fails
`FindSpellBookSlotByID(2963)`). User flagged the bug.

To confirm whether 1.12 had a unified spell-knowledge data structure,
I dumped 5.4.8's `Script_IsPlayerSpell` (5.4 = the version where the
function was first added) and saw a clean bitmap pattern:

```
mov ecx, eax
and ecx, 0x1F            ; bitPos = spellID & 31
shl edx, cl              ; mask = 1 << bitPos
mov ecx, [imm32]         ; bitmap base ptr
shr eax, 5               ; idx = spellID / 32
and eax, [ecx + eax*4]   ; bitmap[idx] & mask
```

Searched 1.12 for the same pattern → matched at the helper
`0x0060C740`, which `Script_GetTalentInfo` calls for currentRank
derivation. Same shape, same purpose, just at a different bitmap
address (`[0x00B710FC]`).

### Modern-parity semantics

Verified against 1.15.x: only the player's currentRank spellID has
its bit set; lower-rank IDs return false. A 5/5 Unbreakable Will
player sees `IsPlayerSpell(14791)` (rank 5) = true but rank 4 / 3 /
2 / 1 = false — same in 1.12 with our implementation, same in 1.15.

This means our implementation matches modern exactly, including the
"only current rank counts" quirk. Addons backporting from later
expansions that key on currentRank's spellID work unmodified.

### Spillover wins for the rest of TODO

The same bitmap makes #30 `IsSpellKnown(spellID, isPet)` trivial —
ship it as a thin wrapper using the same lookup (or split: player
scan via bitmap, pet via existing pet spellbook walk). The
`Spell::Lookup::FindSpellbookSlot` walk is now only needed for the
slot-and-bookType return shape, not for knowledge queries.

See [src/spell/Info.cpp](src/spell/Info.cpp) and
`VAR_PLAYER_SPELL_BITMAP` in [src/Offsets.h](src/Offsets.h).

## 48. `GetSpellCooldown(spellID)` overload — easy

Modern signature accepts a spellID directly. 1.12 only has
`GetSpellCooldown(slot, bookType)` which forces callers to first
resolve a spellID into a spellbook slot (and fails for spellIDs not
in the spellbook — talent passives, recipes, etc.).

The engine clearly tracks cooldowns by spellID internally (the
existing slot-based version reads spellbook[slot] and feeds the
spellID to a downstream cooldown manager). Cross-binary technique
applies cleanly:

1. Find `Script_GetSpellCooldown` in 5.4.8 — the modern overload
   that takes spellID directly.
2. Decode it to identify the cooldown manager's data structure
   (likely a hashmap/array indexed by spellID with `(start, duration,
   enable)` triple per entry).
3. Search 1.12 for the same access pattern.
4. Wrap as a global `GetSpellCooldown(spellIDOrSlot, [bookType])` that
   detects the arg shape and routes accordingly.

Useful for any cooldown-tracking addon that wants to query talent
abilities or off-spellbook spells.

## ~~49. `IsUsableSpell(spell)` / `C_Spell.IsSpellUsable(spellID)`~~ — DONE

Both shipped. `IsUsableSpell` accepts spellID or `(slot, bookType)`
via the same `Spell::Lookup::SpellbookSlotToID` resolver other
spell-API functions use. Returns `(1, nil)` / `(nil, 1)` /
`(nil, nil)` per legacy convention. `C_Spell.IsSpellUsable` is the
modern shape — same logic, returns proper booleans.

**Two engine-cache approaches investigated and discarded:**

1. **Per-spell cache at `0x004F0F40` returning fields at +0x564
   / +0x568** — initially looked promising (the action-bar
   dispatcher at `0x004E5BA0` reads these), but the writers
   (`0x004EFF17` cluster) showed they're parsed config integers,
   not real-time usability bools. False trail.
2. **Action-bar per-slot caches at `0x00BC67A0` (noMana) and
   `0x00BC6B60` (usable)** — these ARE real-time, but only updated
   for the 120 action-bar slots. Spells off the bar stay
   uninitialized. Action-bar-only is the wrong abstraction since
   modern `IsUsableSpell(spellID)` is action-bar-agnostic.

Settled on a **manual five-check approach**:
1. Player knows the spell (`VAR_PLAYER_SPELL_BITMAP` lookup —
   covers profession recipes, talents, racials, etc.).
2. Player is alive (`HEALTH > 0`).
3. Spell is not on cooldown (`FUN_SPELL_QUERY_COOLDOWN` —
   the engine helper `Script_GetSpellCooldown` calls internally
   after slot resolution, queried with `bookType=0` for player).
4. Player has ≥ `ManaCost` of the spell's `PowerType` —
   only this failure flips `noMana=true`.
5. Player has all required reagents in bags
   (`Spell.dbc` Reagent[8] / ReagentCount[8] at `+0x110` /
   `+0x130`, walked via `Item::Location::ResolveBag`).

**Not checked** (deliberate, different concerns): silence, GCD,
stance/form, range, target type, line-of-sight, casting state.

**Verified on Turtle WoW:**
- Mana check: Renew rank 3 (cost 105) reports usable at 144 mana
  and unusable at 39 mana, transitioning exactly at the cost
  boundary.
- Reagent check: SHIPPED BUT UNVERIFIED — the Reagent[8] /
  ReagentCount[8] offsets at `+0x110` / `+0x130` are the
  CMaNGOS-documented vanilla layout, and we know spell records
  match CMaNGOS docs (PowerType=+0x7C and ManaCost=+0x80 both
  match), so high confidence — but no in-game verification yet.
  Should test with a reagent spell (e.g., Mage Teleport spell 3565
  needs Rune of Teleportation 17031). Failure mode if offsets are
  wrong: reagent check becomes a no-op (always passes).
- Cooldown check: SHIPPED BUT UNVERIFIED in this implementation —
  the helper signature was traced via `Script_GetSpellCooldown` at
  `0x004B40A0` but not exercised in-game. Should test with a
  cooldown'd spell.

**Important offset correction along the way.** Initial implementation
read POWER1 at descriptor `+0x5C` based on the CMaNGOS-documented
field index `0x17`. That was *max* mana — current was at `+0x44`
(field index `0x11`, six fields earlier than the standard layout).
The whole UNIT_FIELD layout in 1.12.1 is shifted 0x18 / 6 fields
earlier than CMaNGOS documents:

| Field         | CMaNGOS docs | 1.12.1 actual |
|---------------|-------------:|--------------:|
| HEALTH        | +0x58        | +0x40         |
| POWER1 (mana) | +0x5C        | +0x44         |
| POWER2..5     | +0x60..+0x6C | +0x48..+0x54  |
| MAXHEALTH     | +0x70        | +0x58         |
| MAXPOWER1..5  | +0x74..+0x80 | +0x5C..+0x6C  |
| LEVEL         | +0x88        | +0x70         |
| FLAGS         | +0xA0        | +0xA0 ✓       |

FLAGS still lands at +0xA0 (verified separately by
`Script_UnitPlayerControlled` and `Script_UnitAffectingCombat`).
Trust the binary, verify with `_classicapi_DescDump` if you need
to derive new ones.

See [src/spell/Usable.cpp](src/spell/Usable.cpp).

## 50. Cross-binary technique applications worth picking up — meta

The `IsPlayerSpell` discovery proved out the cross-binary disassembly
technique (documented in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#cross-binary-reference--finding-112-implementations-via-newer-clients)).
Other pending TODOs that look like good fits for the same approach:

- **#7 `UnitAuraBySlot` / `UnitAuraSlots`** — modern slot-based aura
  iteration. Aura state is in CGUnit's UpdateField data; modern
  `UnitAura` reads slot offsets we can decode from 5.4.8 and use in
  1.12.
- **#32 `IsCurrentSpell(spellID)`** — runtime cast-state global. The
  engine has a "currently casting spellID" global (the cast-bar UI
  reads it). Modern's `IsCurrentSpell` reads the same value.
- **#42 `GetTalentIDByIndex`** — already easy with the talent struct
  we now know (talentID at TalentEntry+0x00); cross-binary not needed
  here but could verify against 5.4.8's `GetTalentInfoByID` for
  semantics.

Tag here so we remember the technique exists when picking up these
items.

## ~~51. `C_Container.GetContainerNumFreeSlots(bagID)`~~ — DONE

Returns `(numberOfFreeSlots, bagType)` for the player's backpack
(`bagID = 0`) or one of the four equipped bag slots (`bagID = 1..4`).
`bagType` is the BagFamily bitfield — vanilla 1.12 has only three
non-zero families (quiver=1, ammo pouch=2, soul shard bag=4); modern
expansions added 20+ more, but reading the bitfield gives addons a
forward-compatible shape regardless. Always returns two values, falling
back to `(0, 0)` for unsupported bag IDs (bank/keyring/out-of-range) —
matches 3.3.5's behavior.

Implementation walks the bag and counts empties via
`Item::Location::ResolveBag`. Bag metadata (slot count + BagFamily) for
real bags 1..4 comes from the equipped bag's `ItemStats_C` cache
record: `m_containerSlots` at +0x64, `m_bagFamily` at +0x1D0. Backpack
short-circuits to `(16, 0)` since vanilla's main backpack is fixed-size
and unfamilied. Field offsets derived from VanillaHelpers's
`struct ItemStats_C` layout, cross-checked against the existing
`m_stackable` at +0x60 (already in `Offsets.h`).

The slot-walk uses ResolveBag, which clobbers Lua stack[1]/[2] each
call (a requirement of the engine's `PackBagSlot`). That's safe here —
we own the stack inside the callback and the user's bagID arg is
copied to a local before the loop. Cross-checked in-game against a
manual `GetContainerItemID` walk; counts match for all five bags.

**bagType return is sparse on vanilla data.** Empirically, only Light
Quiver carries a non-zero `m_bagFamily` field among the bags we tested
on Turtle WoW; Soul Pouch, Enchanting Bag, Herb Pouch all return 0.
The same field on individual items (arrows, shards, herbs) is
reliable — see TODO #29's notes. Addons that need bag-category
discrimination should look at `(class, subClass)` from
`GetItemInfoInstant` rather than `bagType`. The conversion from
1.12's raw-ID encoding to the modern bitmask
(`1 << (ID-1)`) still applies for the rare populated cases.

See [src/item/Bag.cpp](src/item/Bag.cpp).

## ~~52. `C_Container.PlayerHasHearthstone()` / `C_Container.UseHearthstone()`~~ — DONE

Modern convenience pair for the most-used bag walk in addons. Walks
bags 0..4 looking for the hearthstone (vanilla itemID 6948 — the only
one in 1.12; modern WoW recognizes many hearthstone-toy itemIDs but
none exist in this client). Stops on first match.

`PlayerHasHearthstone()` returns the itemID (always 6948 or nil).
`UseHearthstone()` invokes the engine's `Script_UseContainerItem`
(`0x004FA0E0`) with `(bagID, slot)` set up on the Lua stack — same
secure-action path a regular `UseContainerItem(bag, slot)` Lua call
would take, so cooldown / combat / movement-cancel handling is
identical. Returns `true` if a hearthstone was found and the call
dispatched, `false` otherwise (the cast itself can still fail
downstream — same caveat as manually calling `UseContainerItem`).

Walking helper is shared between the two via `FindHearthstone(L,
*outBag, *outSlot)`. Slot counts come from delegating to the engine's
own `Script_GetContainerNumSlots` (`0x004F9560`) rather than a
hardcoded vanilla cap, so custom servers with larger-than-24-slot
bags work without code changes.

See [src/item/Hearthstone.cpp](src/item/Hearthstone.cpp).

## ~~53. `LE_EXPANSION_*` constants~~ — DONE

Twelve expansion-level enum globals (`LE_EXPANSION_CLASSIC` through
`LE_EXPANSION_MIDNIGHT`) plus `LE_EXPANSION_LEVEL_CURRENT`, all
matching the canonical retail `Enum.ExpansionLevel` table values.
On 1.12, `LE_EXPANSION_LEVEL_CURRENT` resolves to
`LE_EXPANSION_CLASSIC` (= 0). Lets addons backported from later
expansions use the modern `if LE_EXPANSION_LEVEL_CURRENT < ...`
gating idiom without conditionally defining the constants
themselves.

Set via the same Lua C API path `CLASSIC_API_VERSION` uses (no
`FrameScript_Execute` source). One per entry, written to
`_G[name] = value` from the module's `RegisterLuaFunctions` hook
which fires after the engine's `LoadScriptFunctions` boot phase.

See [src/expansion/Constants.cpp](src/expansion/Constants.cpp).
