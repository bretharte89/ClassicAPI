// (MOD_HEALING_DONE, flat) and 175 (MOD_SPELL_HEALING_OF_STAT_PERCENT,
// ×Spirit) — are decoded inline in `spell/BonusDamage.cpp`. Server-custom
// aura effects (e.g. Turtle's Ironclad, aura 199 = ×Armor) register a
// resolver here so their meaning lives outside the stock decoder.

// stock healing aura.
