// Opt-in persistent name cache, keyed by **name**. When enabled,
// every SMSG_NAME_QUERY_RESPONSE the engine processes — plus
// anything fed in via `C_PlayerCache.RememberPlayer` from Lua — is
// persisted to `WTF\Account\<acct>\<realm>\ClassicAPI_NameCache.txt`
// and survives across sessions on the same realm. Shared across all
// characters on that account+realm, so a 50-character bank alt's
// cache is available to the player's main without duplication.
//
// Use case: addons like pfUI's libunitscan currently keep their own
// per-character SVPC name DB to color chat names by class. With
// this enabled, `GetPlayerInfoByGUID` / `GetPlayerInfoByName` falls
// back to the persistent cache on engine miss, so chat coloring
// Just Works after a /reload — and the data isn't duplicated 50
// times.
//
// Storage model: **name is the primary key**. Vanilla 1.12 enforces
// per-realm name uniqueness server-side, so each name maps to at
// most one live character. GUIDs are unstable — character deletion
// + recreation produces a new GUID for the same name — so keying by
// GUID would mean storing dead identities and needing a name-based
// eviction pass to clean them up. Keying by name makes dedup
// natural (insert-replaces) and eliminates the stale-GUID problem.
// A `guid → name` reverse index gives O(1) lookups in both
// directions. GUIDs are still persisted so addons can recover a
// name from a stored GUID (combat-log replay, etc.).

// `Remember` / eviction; treat as transient.
//
// The name out-param is the entry's key in the primary map —
// passing it by pointer keeps it cheap (no string copy) and lets

// an addon has a player's name (e.g., from a `|Hplayer:Name|h`
