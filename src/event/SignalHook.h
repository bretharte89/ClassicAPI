// Shared interceptor for the engine's no-arg event dispatcher
// `FUN_FIRE_EVENT_NO_ARGS` (`0x00703E50`) — the `__fastcall(int eventID)`
// path every no-arg event broadcast goes through (PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD,
// LOOT_OPENED/CLOSED, zone changes, …), as opposed to the variadic
// `FUN_FIRE_EVENT` used by events that carry a printf-style payload.
//
// MinHook allows only ONE hook per target address, and more than one feature
// needs to intercept this dispatcher (loot silent-scan suppression, the
// PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD payload). So — exactly like `Tick::WorldTick` for the
// per-frame tick — this module owns the single hook and fans out to
// subscribers. Declare a file-scope `static const
// Event::SignalHook::AutoSubscribe` in your module.
//
// An interceptor returns `true` when it has fully handled `eventID` and the
// engine's original no-arg fire must be SUPPRESSED — either because it
// swallowed the event (loot) or re-fired it a different way (the PEW payload
// re-broadcasts through the variadic `FUN_FIRE_EVENT` with args). Returning
// `false` lets the event fall through to the next subscriber and ultimately
// the original. The FIRST subscriber to return `true` wins and the original
// is skipped, so subscribers must claim disjoint event ids.

using Interceptor = bool (*)(int eventID);
