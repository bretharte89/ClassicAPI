// Authoritative "a bag changed this frame" subscription. `Bag::UpdateDelayed`
// co-hooks the three (and only three) engine `BAG_UPDATE` fire sites and
// coalesces them into a single per-frame signal — the same signal that backs
// the `BAG_UPDATE_DELAYED` event. Subscribe here to run C++ work exactly once
// per frame in which any bag actually changed, instead of polling every frame.
//
// Callbacks fire at the tail of the world tick, after every BAG_UPDATE for the
// frame has already fired (so bag contents are settled). No firing on frames
// where nothing changed. Order across subscribers is unspecified.
//
// Module pattern, matching `Tick::WorldTick::AutoSubscribe`: declare a
// file-scope `static const Bag::UpdateDelayed::AutoSubscribe _s{&Callback};`.
