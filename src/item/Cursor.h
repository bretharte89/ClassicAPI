// called directly rather than through the Lua `Script_Pickup*` state-machine
// wrappers (which would require faking the Lua stack). Shared by

// wrapper's behavior: no-op (returns false) when the slot is empty, the
// cursor already holds an item, or the item is locked (mid-transaction).

// (PackBagSlot); stomps the Lua stack.
